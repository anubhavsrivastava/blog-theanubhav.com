For instance, Instagram nearly fell prey to these growing disease early on. When it launched its iPhone app in October 2010, it ran its operation off of a single server in Los Angeles. It worked without being “broken” for a long time. But after an onslaught of traffic nearly crashed the server, Instagram pivoted in three days to an EC2-hosted database.

Both the ‘view’ of situation is correct. Someone would even extend it to say the glass is full with half liquid and half air. But neither of views would helpful if there is no answer to the question of interest. Product team may never feel the need to take care of technical debt. If sufficient users are able to use the system, what’s the problem? If the system is able to convert search-to-book ratio in e-commerce site, where is the debt? If with every release, financial targets are being met, technical things should be good. Right? For most of such bird eye view questions, there is never a Yes - No answer.</p>\n<p>If we peek down over the system to the last point, we might get “Yes” and “No” at different parts of the system. But as explained in <a href="/2019/03/10/dont-delay-technical-debts/">previous blog</a> ‘Product and Technical Debts’ are different view. An addition to technical part is <code class="language-text">Design/Architecture Debt</code> or <code class="language-text">Code Debt</code> or any part you may break it. Code mess is not debt, it is a loss. And there are various development practices to take care of it. Following team guidelines, using Linter, code reviews, design reviews and other mediums to tackle this mess. The decision to make a mess is never rational, is always based on laziness and un-professionalism, and has no chance of paying off in the future. A mess is always a loss.</p>\n<p>A thumb rule used by me to differentiate between the two is, mess is the result of laziness and un-professionalism or lack of desire to make it look correct to oneself. In a way tech debt is the engineering trade-off that software developers and business stakeholders must often make in order to meet schedules and customer expectations. Technical debt decisions are made based on real project constraints. They are risky, but they can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>While is is pretty easy and tempting to go back and forth and argue as to what does or does not constitute a ‘technical debt’ based on how it came about, I think it might be helpful to look at things slightly differently and not get so hung up on the intentions when you took out the loan etc.</p>\n<h3 id="developer-to-do-list"><a href="#developer-to-do-list" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Developer To-do list</h3>\n<p>Some Development Teams fall victim to the way that ‘the business’ keeps prioritizing new features over improving the codebase, while on the other hand holding them responsible for bugs, broken code and the results of technical debt.
